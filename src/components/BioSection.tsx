                Hi! I’m Raman Mishra — a Senior Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience building scalable, fault-tolerant web applications and backend systems for global retail and finance companies.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I specialize in designing and developing high-performance services using <b>Scala</b>, <b>Java</b>, and modern microservice architectures. I enjoy working on systems that handle real-world complexity — from real-time inventory and customer-facing workflows to message-driven, distributed platforms.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                My core technical strengths include <b>Microservices</b>, <b>REST APIs</b>, <b>Event-driven Architecture</b>, and <b>Distributed Systems</b>. I’ve worked extensively with <b>Kafka</b>, <b>Cassandra</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>MongoDB</b>, and backend frameworks like <b>Spring Boot</b> and <b>ZIO</b>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I also have hands-on experience with <b>Kubernetes</b>, <b>Docker</b>, <b>DevOps practices</b>, and building production-ready systems that are reliable, observable, and easy to scale. I strongly value clean code, maintainable architecture, and writing systems that teams can confidently evolve over time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Beyond coding, I enjoy mentoring, code reviews, and helping teams improve engineering quality and delivery speed. I’m comfortable working in globally distributed teams and collaborating across product, engineering, and operations.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email — I’m always happy to talk about backend engineering, system design, or interesting technical challenges.
